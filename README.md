### _Because TwitchPlaysPokemon is so 2014..._

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon">TwitchPlaysPokemon</a> is fun and all, but what if you want to play something else?

Here's a neat little TwitchPlaysPokemon-alike, built with modularity in mind.

## Setup
Grab an oauth token from <a href="www.twitchapps.com/tmi">www.twitchapps.com/tmi</a> and drop it in __cfg.py__ along with your user and channel names, then run __chatbot.py__.

You'll be prompted to choose a configuration file - I've provided one for use with GameBoy games and one for playing the (most excellent) puzzle game _FEZ_.

## On to the Next One
Maybe you want to play something other than FEZ and Kirby's Dream Land.

I hear ya, loud and clear.

You can use __bindingbot.py__ to churn out new configuration files for any game under the sun.

## Thoughts on Variability in Viabilty of Crowd-Sourced Video Game Interaction by way of Internet Relay Chat
One of the big reasons _TwitchPlaysPokemon_ worked as well as it did was Pokemon Red's low penalty for failure.

In what could be described as a _"One step forward, two steps ~~back~~ sideways"_ situation, even the chaotic nature of a noisy Twitch chat would eventually beat the game given enough time.

Other games, like Super Mario Bros. (Super Mario Bros. Deluxe shown here), have a much higher penalty for failure.

As such, these kind of games might require some.. "divine intervention" to be made viable for TwitchPlays-style interaction.
